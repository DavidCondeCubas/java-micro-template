# micro-java-template

A template for a microservices architecture using Java 21, Hexagonal architecture, Lombok, MapStruct, and multimodules can be described as follows:

Microservices Template Description
1. Java 21:
Utilizes Java 21 as the programming language, taking advantage of its features, improvements, and long-term support.

2. Hexagonal Architecture:
Adheres to the Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters or Clean Architecture) for a clear separation of concerns.
Core business logic is at the center (hexagon), surrounded by ports (interfaces) for input and output, keeping the business domain independent of external concerns.

3. Lombok:
Incorporates Lombok to reduce boilerplate code and enhance code readability.
Simplifies the creation of Java beans, builders, and other common structures, leading to more concise and maintainable code.

4. MapStruct:
Integrates MapStruct for seamless and type-safe mapping between objects.
Simplifies the transformation of data objects, ensuring efficient and maintainable object mapping.

5. Multimodules:
Adopts a multimodule project structure for improved organization and modularization.
Divides the application into modules, each responsible for a specific functionality, promoting modularity, and ease of maintenance.

6. Microservices Design:
Designed with a microservices architecture in mind, emphasizing the development of small, independent, and loosely coupled services.
Encourages the use of APIs for communication between services, fostering scalability and flexibility.

7. API First

8. Testing:
Promotes a robust testing strategy, incorporating unit tests, integration tests, and possibly end-to-end tests for ensuring the reliability of the microservices.

9. Dependency Management:
Utilizes a dependency management tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle) to efficiently handle project dependencies and build processes.
